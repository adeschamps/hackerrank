# Functional Programming Contest - October '14 #

Being fairly new to lisp, these problems were good practice for me.
My solution for Expressions V2 worked for the test cases.
I can't seem to find the flaw, although I suspect it has something to do with IO.
It was the first time I've written a lexer though, which was fun.
